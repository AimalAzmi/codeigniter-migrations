# Codeigniter Migrations

Migrate Class to handle migrations within CodeIgniter. Using the Command Line Interface.

## Getting Started

The system requires just the [Migrate.php](https://github.com/AimalAzmi/codeigniter-migrations/blob/master/Migrate.php) to run and [migrate_help.txt](https://github.com/AimalAzmi/codeigniter-migrations/blob/master/migrate_help.txt) to display a help section. Get a copy of both.

Place both the files in your codeigniter_project/application/controllers folder and you're good to go.

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite for the class to function is a working DB connection.

## Using the class

The class uses the Command Line Interface. Open up a terminal/cmd and navigate to your project folder. 

### Running commands

To get familiar with the available methods enter the following in the terminal/cmd after navigating to the project folder.

```
php index.php migrate help
```
and you should have a help section that explains everything quite briefly on how everything works.
